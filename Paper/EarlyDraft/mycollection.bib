abstract = {The miniaturization of droplet manipulation methods has led to drops being proposed as microreactors in many applications of biology and chemistry. In parallel, microfluidic methods have been applied to generate monodisperse emulsions for applications in the pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food industries. To date, microfluidic droplet production has been dominated by a few designs that use hydrodynamic forces, resulting from the flowing fluids, to break drops at a junction. Here we present a platform for droplet generation and manipulation that does not depend on the fluid flows. Instead, we use devices that incorporate height variations to subject the immiscible interfaces to gradients of confinement. The resulting curvature imbalance along the interface causes the detachment of monodisperse droplets, without the need for a flow of the external phase. Once detached, the drops are self-propelled due to the gradient of surface energy. We show that the size of the drops is determined by the device geometry; it is insensitive to the physical fluid properties and depends very weakly on the flow rate of the dispersed phase. This allows us to propose a geometric theoretical model that predicts the dependence of droplet size on the geometric parameters, which is in agreement with experimental measurements. The approach presented here can be applied in a wide range of standard applications, while simplifying the device operations. We demonstrate examples for single-droplet operations and high-throughput generation of emulsions, all of which are performed in simple and inexpensive devices.},

abstract = {The ability to separate liquid and gas phases in the absence of a gravitational acceleration has proven a challenge to engineers since the inception of space exploration. Due to our singular experience with terrestrial systems, artificial body forces are often imparted in multiphase fluid systems aboard spacecraft to reproduce the buoyancy effect. This approach tends to be inefficient, adding complexity, resources, and failure modes. Ever present in multiphase phenomena, the forces of surface tension can be exploited to aid passive phase separations where performance characteristics are determined solely by geometric design and system wettability. Said systems may be readily designed as demonstrated herein where a regulated bubbly flow is drawn through an open triangular sectioned duct. The bubbles passively migrate toward the free surface where they coalesce and leave the flow. The tests clearly show container aspect ratios required for passive phase separations for various liquid and gas flow rates. Preliminary data are presented as regime maps demarking complete phase separation. Long duration microgravity experiments are performed aboard the International Space Station. Supplementary experiments are conducted using a drop tower. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We investigate experimentally the spontaneous motion of drops and bubbles confined between two plates forming a narrow wedge. Such discoidal objects migrate under the gradient in interfacial energy induced by the non-homogeneous confinement. The resulting capillary driving force is balanced by viscous resistance. The viscous friction on a drop bridging parallel plates is estimated by measuring its sliding velocity under gravity. The viscous forces are the sum of two contributions, from the bulk of the liquid and from contact lines, the relative strength of which depends on the drop size and velocity and the physical properties of the liquid. The balance of capillarity and viscosity quantitatively explains the dynamics of spontaneous migration of a drop in a wedge. Close the tip of the wedge, bulk dissipation dominates and the migrating velocity of drops is constant and independent of drop volume. The distance between the drop and the tip of the wedge is thus linear with time t, x(t) ∼ t 0 − t, where t 0 is the time at which the drop reaches the tip of the wedge. Far away from the apex, contact lines dominate the friction, the motion is accelerated toward the tip of the wedge and velocities are higher for larger drops. In this regime, it is shown that x(t) ∼ (t 0 − t) 4/13 . The position and time of the crossover between the two dissipation regimes are used to write a dimensionless equation of motion. Plotted in rescaled variables, all experimental trajectories collapse to the prediction of our model. In contrast to drops, gas bubbles in a liquid-filled wedge behave as non-wetting objects. They thus escape the confinement of the wedge to reduce their surface area. The physical mechanisms involved are similar for drops and bubbles, so that the forces acting have the same mathematical structures in both cases, except for the sign of the capillary driving force and a numerical factor. We thus predict and show experimentally that the trajectories of drops and bubbles obey the same equation of motion, except for a change in the sign of t 0 − t.},

abstract = {The behavior of droplets trapped in geometric structures is essential to droplet manipulation applications such as for droplet transport. Here we show that directional droplet movement can be realized by a V-shaped groove with the movement direction controlled by adjusting the surface wettability of the groove inner wall and the cross sectional angle of the groove. Experiments and analyses show that a droplet in a superhydrophobic groove translates from the immersed state to the suspended state as the cross sectional angle of the groove decreases and the suspended droplet departs from the groove bottom as the droplet volume increases. We also demonstrate that this simple grooved structure can be used to separate a water-oil mixture and generate droplets with the desired sizes. The structural effect actuated droplet movements provide a controllable droplet transport method which can be used in a wide range of droplet manipulation applications.},
